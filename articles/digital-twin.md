## Headings

The supply chain digital twin is a detailed simulation model of your supply chain which uses snapshots and real-time data to predict supply chain performance and risks.
The visualization contextualizes the data, making it easy for you to understand your supply chainâ€™s performance, identify risks, predict abnormal situations, and simulate alternatives to create an action plan. 

# Prerequisites
The digital twin requires data to have been ingested according to the process described in [data ingestion](relative link). 
Data for all entities should be imported because this is required for all analytic features to run and helps to ensure the analytics are accurate, but the specific data entities required for each digital twin feature is listed within each feature's description below.

# Production plants, warehouse, supplier, and product tree
## Purpose
This digital twin shows a network tree of production plants, warehouses, products, parts, and vendors.
It helps you visualize what your products depend on by highlighting the relationships between them, the components or raw materials needed to build the products, and vendors who supply these components or raw materials.
