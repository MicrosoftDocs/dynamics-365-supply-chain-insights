This topic describes data resiliency, compliance, and security as it relates to the handling of information in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights.

As a Microsoft product, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights is backed by Microsoft's Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) team to ensure that the application and all of the data associated with it are resilient. To check if Supply Chain Insights meets your organization's requirements for resilience, please review Microsoft's documentation for [Resiliency and continuity overview](/compliance/assurance/assurance-resiliency-and-continuity)*.

> [NOTE]
> Since it is a new product in public preview, Supply Chain Insights has yet to meet the external regulation and certification requirements for Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365. These requirements will be fulfilled before the product is generally available. 

## Compliance

Supply Chain Insights was designed with compliance, privacy, security, and confidentiality in mind and is only intended to be used to identify and mitigate risks related to your supply chain. Microsoft offers Supply Chain Insights under the Microsoft Online Services terms, which includes robust data protection terms.

To determine if Supply Chain Insights meets your compliance requirements, see [Licensing Terms | Microsoft Volume Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products?rtc=1) and [Privacy and personal data for Microsoft Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/get-started/gdpr/). 

It is your responsibility to:
- Inform your customers of your data processing practices, for example by disclosing the data that you collect and how it is used.
- Disclose your use of third parties working on your behalf to process the data you collect, including service providers for Supply Chain Insights.
- Comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the use of Supply Chain Insights, including data protection laws.

## Security

By providing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights, which may include sharing data with other users of the application, Microsoft has implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect customer data. Such data includes personal data and company data that has been copied to a another region to be shared with a partner who stores their data in a different location from your company. These measures are set forth in Microsoft security policy that will be made available to customers, along with descriptions of the security controls in place for Supply Chain Insights and other information reasonably requested by customers regarding Microsoft security practices and policies.

To learn more about Microsoft's security practices, visit the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center).

## Data sharing

Supply Chain Insights shares data between participants only when explicitly instructed to via data collaborations. Participants agree that in order to share customer data as instructed, Microsoft may need to store a copy of said customer data in any or all of the geographic regions where the other participants in the collaboration are located. To learn more about data sharing, see [Data collaborations](create-collaboration.md) and the [Supply Chain Insights terms of service agreement](https://aka.ms/scitc). 

You agree that in order to share customer data as you instruct, Microsoft may need to store a copy of said customer data in any or all of the geographic regions in which the services store customer data, provided that the services will only make such data available to other users as you instruct.
