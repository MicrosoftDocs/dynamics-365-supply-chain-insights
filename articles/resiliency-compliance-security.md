# Data Resiliency
As a Microsoft product, Supply Chain Insights is backed by Microsoft's Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) team to ensure that the application, and all of the data associated with it,  are resilient. To see if Supply Chain Insights meets your organization's requirements for resilience, please review Microsoft's documentation for [Resiliency and continuity overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-resiliency-and-continuity)*.

*Please not that Supply Chain Insights has yet to complete the external regulations and certifications for Azure and Dynamics 365, as it is a new product in public preview. These will be completed before the product is generally available. 

# Compliance
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights was designed with compliance, privacy, security, and confidentiality in mind and is only intended to be used to identify and mitigate risks related to your supply chain. Microsoft offers Supply Chain Insights under the Microsoft Online Services Terms, which includes robust Data Protection Terms.

Determine if Supply Chain Insights meets your compliance requirements by reviewing the [Microsoft Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products?rtc=1) and [Privacy and Personal Data for Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/get-started/gdpr/) documentation page. 

It is your responsibility to:
	• Inform your customers of your data processing practice, for example by disclosing the data you collect and how it is used.
	• Disclose your use of third parties working on your behalf to process the data you collect, including service providers for Supply Chain Insights.
	• Comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the use of Supply Chain Insights, including data protection laws.

# Security
By providing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights, which may include sharing data with other users of the application, Microsoft has implemented, and will maintain, appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Customer Data, which includes personal data and your data that has been copied to a different region to be shared with a partner who stores their data in a different location from you. These measures are set forth in Microsoft Security Policy. Microsoft will make that policy available to customers, along with descriptions of the security controls in place for Supply Chain Insights, and other information reasonably requested by the customer regarding Microsoft security practices and policies.
