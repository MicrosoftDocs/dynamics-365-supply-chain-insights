# Data resiliency

This topic describes data resiliency, compliance, and security as they are related to the handling of information in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights.

As a Microsoft product, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights is backed by Microsoft's Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) team. This team ensures that the application and all the data that is associated with it are resilient. To determine whether Supply Chain Insights meets your own organization's requirements for resilience, see [Resiliency and continuity overview](/compliance/assurance/assurance-resiliency-and-continuity).

> [NOTE]
> Because Supply Chain Insights is a new product in public preview, it hasn't yet met the external regulation and certification requirements for Azure and Dynamics 365. These requirements will be met before the product is generally available.

## Compliance

Supply Chain Insights was designed with compliance, privacy, security, and confidentiality in mind. It's intended to be used only to identify and mitigate risks that are related to your supply chain. Microsoft offers Supply Chain Insights under the Microsoft Online Services terms, which include robust data protection terms.

To determine whether Supply Chain Insights meets your compliance requirements, see [Licensing Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products?rtc=1) and [Privacy and personal data for Microsoft Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/get-started/gdpr/).

You have the following responsibilities:

- Inform your customers about your data processing practices. For example, disclose what data you collect and how it's used.
- Disclose your use of third parties that work on your behalf to process the data that you collect. These third parties include service providers for Supply Chain Insights.
- Comply with all laws and regulations that are applicable to the use of Supply Chain Insights. These laws and regulations include data protection laws.

## Security

Supply Chain Insights might include data sharing with other users of the application. Therefore, Microsoft has implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect customer data. This data includes personal data and company data that has been copied to another region so that it can be shared with a partner that stores its data in a different location than your company. These measures are described in the Microsoft security policy that will be made available to customers, together with descriptions of the security controls that are in place for Supply Chain Insights and other information that customers might reasonably request about Microsoft security practices and policies.

To learn more about Microsoft's security practices, visit the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center).

## Data sharing

Supply Chain Insights shares data between participants only when it's explicitly instructed to do so via data collaborations. The participants in a collaboration agree that, to share customer data as they instruct, Microsoft might have to store a copy of that data in any or all of the geographic regions where the other participants are located. For more information about data sharing, see [Data collaborations](create-collaboration.md) and the [Supply Chain Insights terms of service agreement](https://aka.ms/scitc).

You agree that, to share customer data as you instruct, Microsoft might have to store a copy of that data in any or all of the geographic regions where the services store customer data, provided that the services will make the data available to other users only as you instruct.
