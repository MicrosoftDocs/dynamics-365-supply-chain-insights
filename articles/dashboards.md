# Prerequisites
Analytics requires data to have been ingested according to the process described in [Ingestion](/articles/ingestion.md).
Data for all entities should be imported because this is required for all analytic features to run and helps to ensure the analytics are accurate, but the specific data entities required for each analytic feature is listed within each feature's description below.


# Supply and demand

The "Supply and demand" dashboard gives an overview of how much interest various parts have relative to your inventory. 
Using the information provided on this dashboard, it's easy to identify which parts have the greatest shortage or greatest oversupply based on a variety of conditions such as time range, partner, product, etc.
