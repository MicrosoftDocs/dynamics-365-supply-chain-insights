This topic describes the requirements and instructions for signing up for and setting up Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights.

## Sign up for the public preview

There are two ways to sign up for the public preview of Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights. The first method is to sign up from the [Supply Chain Insights home page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/supply-chain-insights/). The second method is to sign up through an invitation that is sent from a company that is already a public preview user. Regardless of the method that they use, companies that sign up will be contacted by the Supply Chain Insights team via email. The email that they receive will provide information about how to register as a public preview user.

## Prerequisites

- Supply Chain Insights is currently available only in the English, German, and Chinese languages.
- Supply Chain Insights supports only the most recent and second most recent versions of the Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers.
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant is required. A tenant represents an organization in Azure AD and lets you manage user access to Azure resources to ensure controlled access to your data. If your business already has an Azure AD tenant, contact your Azure AD tenant administrator or IT department, and have them sign up for Supply Chain Insights. If your business doesn't yet have an Azure AD tenant, you will be prompted to create one during the Supply Chain Insights sign-up process.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also follow the steps in [Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory](/fraud-protection/provision-azure-tenant#create-and-provision-a-new-tenant-in-azure-ad) to create and provision a new Azure AD tenant.

## Get started
