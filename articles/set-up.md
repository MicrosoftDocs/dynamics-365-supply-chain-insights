# Public preview enrollment
There are two ways to sign up for the public preview of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights. The first is directly through the [marketing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/supply-chain-insights/). The second method is by signing up through an invitation sent from a company who is already a public preview user. Companies who sign up using either method will be contacted by email from the Supply Chain Insights team on a rolling basis to then register as a user.

# Prerequisites
Supply Chain Insights is currently only available in English, Germany, and Chinese.

The most and second most recent versions of Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari are supported.

An Azure Active Directory tenant is needed. A tenant represents an organization within Microsoft Azure Active Directory and is a way to manage user access to Azure resources to ensure control access to your data. Contact your Azure Active Directory tenant admin or IT department and have them sign up for Supply Chain Insights if your business already has an Azure Active Directory tenant. Otherwise, you will be prompted during the sign up process for Supply Chain Insights to create an Azure Active Directory tenant if your business does not already have one. You can also follow the steps in [Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/provision-azure-tenant#create-and-provision-a-new-tenant-in-azure-ad) to create and provision a new Azure tenant.


# Getting started
1. After receiving an email invitation to join Supply Chain Insights as a user, go to [sci.dynamics.com](https://sci.dynamics.com/) and complete the prompts to create and/or provision your Azure Active Directory tenant. 
1. Accept the popup request asking for access to your location. This will be used to offer better suggestions as you search for locations in the next two steps.
1. Search for and select your company location. 
1. Search for and select your vendor location(s). 
1. Click the "Get Started" button. 
1. Complete the three steps displayed in the onboarding section of Supply Chain Insight's home page to provide the application with more information to deliver you accurate insights. These three steps are [import your data](/articles/ingestion.md), complete your [company profile](/articles/company-profile.md), and [create your supply chain network](/articles/partners.md).
