This topic describes how to review, edit, and delete data collaborations in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights.

What data you need to know and need to share with your partners can change over time. To accommodate these changes, you can review, edit, and delete data collaborations as needed.

## Review and edit your organization's collaborations

Data collaborations that you create are listed under **My organization's collaborations** on the Supply Chain Insights **Data collaborations** page. Select a collaboration to  review or edit it.

## Partners tab

The **Partners** tab lists partners who have been invited or have accepted an invitation for a data collaboration. You can remove a partner from a collaboration by selecting the vertical ellipsis contextual menu for a partner. Alternatively, you can add more partners in addition to those specified when you first made a collaboration by selecting **Add partners** on the top left.

### Data shared tab

The **Data shared** tab contains information on what data you are sharing with the partners in a collaboration. To update what data you are giving your partners, update the checkbox values in the **Share?** column.

### Data requested tab

The **Data requested** tab contains information on what data you are requesting from the partners in the collaboration. To update what data you want from your partners, update the checkbox values in the **Request to share?** column.

### Delete collaborations

You can delete a collaboration on the **My organizations' collaborations** tab by selecting the collaboration and then selecting **Delete** on the top left. While it is possible to delete your own collaborations, you can't delete your partners' collaborations.

## Review and edit your partners' collaborations

To review or change what data you're sharing in a partner's collaboration, first find the collaboration on the **Partners' collaborations** tab of the **Data collaborations** page. Then go to the **Data requested** tab and update the checkbox values accordingly under the **Share?** column, and then select **Save changes** on the top right. If you no longer want to share any data you can clear all of the checkbox values, or you can leave the collaboration entirely by selecting **Leave collaboration** on the top left.

## Data deletion notice

When data is deleted from a collaboration in Supply Chain Insights, the original source of the data Supply Chain Insights ingested is not affected. Data can be deleted from Supply Chain Insights when you remove requested entities from collaborations under **My organization's collaborations**, or when you delete one of these collaborations. Similarly, data can be deleted when you stop sharing entities amongst collaborations listed under **Partners' collaborations**, or when you leave one of those collaborations. 

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 48 hours for data deletion to take effect.
