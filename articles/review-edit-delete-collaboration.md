What you need to know and need to share with your partners can change over time. To accommodate these changes, you can review, edit, and delete collaborations as needed.

# Review and edit your organization's collaborations
Data collaborations you create will be listed under the "My organization's collaborations" of the  "Data collaborations" section of the application. Select a collaboration to learn more about it or to edit it.

## Partners
The "Partners" tab includes a list of partners who have been invited or accepted the invitation to the data collaboration. Clicking the contextual menu for a partner on this tab gives you the ability to remove a partner from the collaboration. Alternatively, you can add more partners beyond the ones from when you first made the collaboration by selecting the "Add partners" button in the top left.

## What you are sharing
The "Data shared" tab contains information on what data you are sharing with the partners in the collaboration. Change the toggles in the "Share?" column to update what data you are giving your partners.

## What your partners are sharing
The "Data requested" tab contains information on what data you are requesting from the partners in the collaboration. Change the toggles in the "Request to share?" column to update what data you want from your partners.

## Delete collaboration
You may delete collaborations under the "My organizations' collaborations" tab. After selecting the collaboration of interest, there is a "Delete" button in the top left. While it is possible to delete your own collaborations, you can't delete your partners' collaborations and can only leave them.

# Review and edit your partners' collaborations
If you wish to review or change what data you're sharing in a partner's collaboration, find the collaboration within the "Partners' collaborations" tab of the "Data collaborations" section of the application. Then go to the "Data requested" tab and change the toggles accordingly under the "Share?" column before selecting "Save changes" in the top right. If you no longer wish to share any data, you can turn all of the toggles off or leave the collaboration entirely by the "Leave collaboration" button in the top left.

# Data deletion notice
When data is deleted from a collaboration in Supply Chain Insights, the original source where Supply Chain Insights ingests the data from along with any other collaborations are not affected. Data may be deleted from Supply Chain Insights when you remove requested entities amongst collaborations within "My organization's collaborations" or when you delete one of these collaborations. Similarly, data may be deleted when you stop sharing entities amongst collaborations within "Partners' collaborations" or when you leave one of these collaborations. Please note that it can take up to 48 hours for this change to take effect.
