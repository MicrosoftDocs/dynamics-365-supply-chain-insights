# Today's supply chain problem
Supply chains are exposed to risks caused by rapidly changing internal and external conditions. Whether a business partner is running late on a delivery or a natural 
disaster has occurred in the area of a business' warehouse, it is difficult to identify, let alone anticipate or adapt to, these risks and work with business partners
to address them. This is because current approaches to supply chain management lack visibility into companies' multi-tier supply chain network and don't consider relevant
world events because they are disconnected from the external environment.]

# Our mission to solve today's problem
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights provides your business with the ability to quickly respond to upcoming or sudden changes in your supply chain. This is 
accomplished through risk insights and mitigation features. Insights enable a better understanding of the risks whereas the mitigation features enables you to organize 
these insights and collaborate with your partners to solve the problem.

# How we help you identify and respond to risks
Supply Chain Insights delivers insights by presenting an overview of your supply chain with potential risks through a map and dashboards. The map and dashboards are the output of an 
analysis of your data, your partners' data, and external data sources. Gathering this data is easy because Supply Chain Insights contains a seamless data ingestion process for 
a wide variety of sources, makes partner discovery and onboarding simple, and automatically combines user's data with that of external risk factors. 

Supply Chain Insights also supports you in quickly responding to the risks insights it surfaces. Surveys enable you to contact your business partners within SCI to gather 
information on the impact of the risk whereas mitigation cases are a way of organizing information on risk insights and tracking mitigation progress.
