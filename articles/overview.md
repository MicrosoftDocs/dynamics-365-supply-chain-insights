# Today's problem
Supply chains are not resilient today despite their constant exposure to risks caused by rapidly changing internal and external conditions. Whether a business partner is running late on a delivery or a natural disaster has occurred in the area of a business' warehouse, it is difficult to identify, let alone anticipate or adapt to, these risks and work with business partners to address them. This is because current approaches to supply chain management lack visibility into companies' multi-tier supply chain network and don't consider relevant world events because they are disconnected from the external environment.

# Our mission
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights provides your business with the ability to quickly respond to upcoming or sudden changes in your supply chain. This is accomplished through risk insights which enable a better understanding of how internal and external changes may impact your supply chain.

# How we help you identify risks
Supply Chain Insights delivers insights by presenting an overview of your supply chain with potential risks through a map and dashboards. The map and dashboards are the output of an analysis of your data, your partners' data, and external data sources. Gathering this data is easy because Supply Chain Insights contains a seamless data ingestion process for a wide variety of sources, makes partner discovery and collaboration simple, and automatically combines users data with that of external risk factors.
