This topic provides an overview of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights and the value it brings to users.

Supply chains are not resilient today in the face of constant exposure to risks caused by rapidly changing internal and external conditions. Whether a business partner is running late on a delivery or a natural disaster has occurred in the area of a business's warehouse, it is difficult to anticipate, identify, and adapt to these types of risks and work with business partners to address them. This is because current approaches to supply chain management lack visibility into companies' multi-tier supply chain networks and don't consider relevant world events because they are disconnected from the external environment.

## The Supply Chain Insights mission

Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights provides your business with the ability to quickly respond to upcoming or sudden changes in your supply chain. This is achieved through risk insights that enable a better understanding of how internal and external changes may impact your supply chain.

## How Supply Chain Insights helps you identify risks

Supply Chain Insights helps you identify risks by presenting an overview of your supply chain and relevant potential risks via a map and dashboards powered by the analysis of your data, your partners' data, and external data sources. Supply Chain Insights gathers this information by means of a robust data ingestion process that compiles data from a wide variety of sources, and makes partner discovery and collaboration simple by automatically combining users' data with that of external risk factors.
