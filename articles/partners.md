Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights aims to enable users to identify and respond to risks by providing insights through greater visibility into your supply chain. 
To achieve this mission, users must connect within Supply Chain Insights to generate greater visibility. 
The Partners section of Supply Chain Insights is what enables this, allowing you to review and manage your Partners.

# Prerequisites


# Making connections
## Prerequisites
It is recommended that you have completed your company's profile and have ingested data before adding Partners because Supply Chain Insights will try to suggest partners based on the data you import and your company's industry.
If you wish to add a company which Supply Chain Insights has not suggested, detected, or partially detected from your data, then you may need to have the company name, vendor ID, DUNS number, and contact email on hand.

## Find partners
"Find partners" contains a list of companies who have completed Supply Chain Insight's onboarding. These companies are from the same industry as you who have made their company profile visible. Selecting a company name or entire card will bring up a sidebar containing that company's profile if you'd like to learn more about them before connecting. If there are many companies under "Find partners," you can use the search bar and filters to narrow down the results. If the company you're looking for is not available, you can manually invite them by clicking "Invite partners." This option is available at the top-left of the page, at the bottom of the "Find partners" list, or when there are no results after filtering and searching the "Find partners" list.

Choosing "Connect" on the company profile sidebar or directly from the company's card will prompt you to define your relationship with that company and write an optional note which will be attached to the invitation. Alternatively, this can also be done by selecting "Invite partners" to invite companies outside of the "Find partners" list by using their email. Once you select "Apply," a new request will appear under the pending invitations within "Sent requests."

## Imported
The  "Imported" tab consists of a list containing companies Supply Chain Insights has detected based on your ingested data for the customer and vendor entities, but these companies are ones who have not joined Supply Chain Insights. You can import more data to Supply Chain Insights using the "Import partners" button in the top left to add more companies to the list. Companies can then be invited to join Supply Chain Insights as your partner. Once invited, those companies will move from the 'Imported" to "Sent requests" tab. Imported companies who don't have a contact email are unable to be invited, because that email is used to send the invitation.

## Incoming requests
Incoming requests will be received via email for companies who have not joined Supply Chain Insights and will be found under the "Incoming requests" tab for those who have joined. Clicking "Reply" to a given request pulls up a sidebar to enter your response. Once completed, the request will no longer show up as a pending request under "Incoming requests." The company will be listed under "My partners" if the request was accepted or the request will be declined and remain in "Incoming requests."

## Sent requests
You can view the status of requests which have not been accepted yet. If a request has been accepted, the company will be listed under "My partners." Otherwise, the invitation will be pending or declined, and can be resent in either case.

# Managing connections
"My partners" contains a list of companies you have connected with on Supply Chain Insights. A search bar and filters are available to more easily find the partner you're looking for. For each partner, you can manage your relationship, view what collaborations have been established, start a new collaboration with them, view their company profile, and remove your connection with them.
