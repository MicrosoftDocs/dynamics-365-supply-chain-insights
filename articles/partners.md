Connect with your vendors and customers for sharing data and getting greater visibility into your supply chain. You may invite your existing vendors and suppliers into Supply Chain Insights to connect, or find new partners to connect with. Knowing who these partners are and connecting with them is vital for having a simple process to incorporate their data into your insights.
 
Connected partners can start collaborating and sharing data. Your participant’s contact email address and any data provided in your company profile general information will be shared with all of your connected partners.


# Making connections
## Prerequisites
It is recommended that you have completed your company's profile before adding partners because Supply Chain Insights will suggest partners based on the data you import and your company's industry. If you wish to add a company which Supply Chain Insights has not suggested or detected, then you may need to have the company name, vendor ID, DUNS number, and contact email on hand to manually connect with them.

## Find and connect with partners
"Find partners" contains a list of companies who joined Supply Chain Insights. Once you connect with a partner, your participant name, contact email address, and any details you’ve provided in your company profile general information, will be visible to that partner.
Selecting a partner name or entire card will bring up a sidebar containing that company's profile if you'd like to learn more about them before connecting. 
When requesting to connect with a partner, you can add a customized note to personalize your request. If a partner you are connecting with already exists in your ERP system as a vendor or customer, you can identify them accordingly by setting the “Relationship” field, and add their vendor ID or customer ID. The relationship value and any vendor or customer ID you provide will not be visible to the partner you are requesting to connect to. You cant track the status of your request to connect under the pending invitations within "Sent requests."
 
You can use the search bar and filters for finding specific partners. If the partner you're looking for is not available, you can invite them to join Supply Chain Insights by clicking "Invite partners." 
 
Choosing "Connect" on the company profile sidebar or directly from the company's card will prompt you to define your relationship with that company and write an optional note which will be attached to the invitation. Alternatively, this can also be done by selecting "Invite partners" to invite companies outside of the "Find partners" list by using their email. You can track the status of your request to connect under the pending requests within "Sent requests."
 
## Invite your existing vendors and customers to connect over Supply Chain Insights
In addition to connecting with new partners, you can invite your existing vendors and customers to join and connect over Supply Chain Insights. You can invite your partners from the “Find Partners” tab or from the “Imported” tab. You can either invite customers and vendors that you have already imported to Supply Chain Insights, or invite a single partner that was not imported. It is required to include the partner name and email address for inviting them into Supply Chain Insights. When inviting a vendor or a customer, you can add a customized note to personalize your request. 
 
Once you click “Invite”, an email invitation will be sent to your customer or vendor from a Microsoft mailbox where they will be invited to join Supply Chain Insights. Let your partners know that they should expect an email from Microsoft, as it might appear in their spam folder. After the invited partners join Supply Chain Insights, they will see an incoming “Connect” request from your participant, and will be able to accept your request for beginning to collaborate and share data. You can track the status of your invitation under the pending requests within "Sent requests."

## Imported
The  "Imported" tab consists of a list containing companies Supply Chain Insights has detected based on your ingested data for the customer and vendor entities, but these companies are ones who have not joined Supply Chain Insights.  You can import additional partners by clicking the "Import partners" button in the top left. You can invite any of these customers and vendors to join Supply Chain Insights and connect, for sharing data and collaborating.

## Incoming requests
Under Incoming requests, you can see any requests to connect with partners. You can choose to accept or decline any connect request. It is required to connect with partners in order to receive data from them, or sharing your own data with them. Once you connect with a partner, you can find it under “"My partners.

## Sent requests
You can view the status of requests which have not been accepted yet. If a request has been accepted, the company will be listed under "My partners." Otherwise, the invitation will be pending or declined.

# Managing connections
"My partners" contains a list of companies you have connected with on Supply Chain Insights.  A search bar and filters are available to more easily find the partner you're looking for. For each partner, you can manage your relationship, start a new data collaboration with them, view what collaborations have been established with them, and view their company profile general information.
