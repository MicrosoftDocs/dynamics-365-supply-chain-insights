# Partner management

With Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights, you can connect with your vendors and customers to collaborate, share data, and gain greater visibility into your supply chain. You can invite your existing vendors and suppliers to connect in Supply Chain Insights, or find new partners to connect with.  

You should complete your [company profile](company-profile.md) before you add partners. Supply Chain Insights will suggest partners based on the data in your profile and the industry your company is part of. When you connect with a partner, your contact email address and any other data provided in the **General information** section of your company profile is shared with the partner. 


## Find and connect with partners
To display a list of companies who have joined Supply Chain Insights, go to **Partners > All partners > Find partners**. Select a partner name or card to display the partner's company profile. To request to connect to a partner, select **Connect** on the partner card. When you make your request, you can add a customized note to personalize your request. 

You can use the search field and filters to find specific partners. If the partner you're looking for isn't found, you can invite them to join Supply Chain Insights by selecting **Invite partners** on the upper left side of the page. You may need to have the company name, vendor ID, DUNS number, and contact email to manually add them.

The **Imported** tab displays a list of companies that haven't joined Supply Chain Insights but have been detected based on your ingested data for customer and vendor entities. To invite a partner that was previously imported to Supply Chain Insights, select **Invite** next to the partner's name on the **Imported** tab. After you select **Invite**, an email invitation is sent to the partner from a Microsoft mailbox. You should let the partner know that they should expect an email from Microsoft, as it might be routed to their spam folder. After the partner joins Supply Chain Insights, they will receive a connect request from your participant. After they accept the request, they can collaborate and share data. 

You can import additional partners by selecting **Import partners** on the upper left side of the page. 

If a partner you are connecting with already exists in your ERP system as a vendor or customer, you can identify them by setting the **Relationship** field on the **My partners** tab, and add their vendor ID or customer ID. The **Relationship** value and any vendor or customer ID you provide will not be visible to the partner. 

## Incoming requests
The **Incoming requests** tab displays requests from partners to connect with them. You can choose to accept or decline the requests on this tab. Once you connect with a partner, you can find the partner on the **My partners** tab.

## Sent requests
The **Sent requests** tab displays the status of requests that haven't been accepted. The requests will be listed as "Pending" or "Declined". Once a request is accepted, the company will be listed on the **My partners** tab. 

## Manage connections
The **My partners** tab contains a list of companies you have connected with in Supply Chain Insights. You can manage your relationship, [start a new data collaboration with them](/articles/create-collaboration.md), [view the collaborations that have been established with them](/articles/review-edit-delete-collaboration.md), and view the general information included in their company profile.
