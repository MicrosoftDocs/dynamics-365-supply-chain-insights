Supply Chain Insights lets users to customize their experience in the settings, making it easier for them to use the product. Users can edit the theme, language and time zone, password, and their company profile.

# Themes
Change how Supply Chain Insights looks by updating the theme to something that suits your preferences.

# Language and time 
Update the language, time zone, and date format based upon how and where you are using Supply Chain Insights.

# Password
Supply Chain Insights uses the same login account as the admin for its Azure Active Directory tenant. Clicking "Change your password" will therefore bring you to a page that will update the password for your Azure Active Directory admin.

# Contact preferences
Similar to updating the password, clicking on "Update contact preferences" will bring one into the profile of the Microsoft account associated with the Azure Active Directory admin. Contact preferences are found at the bottom of this page.

# Company profile
Supply Chain Insights aims to enable users to identify and respond to risks by providing insights through greater visibility into your supply chain. To achieve this mission, users must be able to identify and work with their partners. The company profile is what enables this, allowing you to create a bio and set your visibility for partners and potential partners to learn more about you.

## Setup
Completing your company profile is the second recommended onboarding step because Supply Chain Insights uses this information to generate insights specific to a user's company. The company profile will only contain the company's name and profile picture based upon your Azure Active Directory tenant initially. Every part of each company profile section can be completed individually in the event that a user does not have all the information on hand. By clicking the "Edit" or "Add" button in the upper right-hand corner of the respective part, you can complete or update their company profile according to the pane that will appear on the right.

## Visibility
Under the  "Basic information" tab of the "Company profile" page, there is an option to make the company profile public or private to others. A private company profile will not be discoverable from the "Find partners" tab of the "Partner management" page, but it will be viewable by any connected Partners. A public company profile will be discoverable from the 'Find partners" tab, and is viewable by any connected  Partners.
