# Review
Review the ingested data for a given entity by clicking on the name of that entity on the main data import page. 
This displays a new page with a table containing all the data Supply Chain Insights has for the attributes of that entity.

# Edit
Editing ingested data is vital for ensuring that Supply Chain Insight's analysis is accurate because it lets you ensure that the data used for those insights are accurate. 
Selecting "Edit" on the contextual menu brought up by the three dots icon next to the name of the entity on the main data import page is one method of navigating to the data edit page. 
There is also an "Edit" button in the top right when reviewing the data for a given entity.

# Delete
Data delete helps you resolve an issue or error in the ingested data such as an incorrect data mapping or incorrect ingested data. 
This enables correct data for correct insights while letting users protect their privacy and security. 
Data delete lets you choose if you also wish to stop the refresh schedule for entities that have them. 
Currently, users are only able to delete all ingested data at once for public preview. Please note that data delete will take 24-48 hours to complete.

# Export and download
Data export and download enables further analytics or partner collaboration outside the scope of Supply Chain Insights by letting you use the data for an entity elsewhere. 
The format of the data will mirror what is seen in data review.
