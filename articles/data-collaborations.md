Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights aims to enable users to identify and respond to risks by providing insights through greater visibility into your supply chain. To achieve this mission, Participants must be able to incorporate their partner's data within Supply Chain Insights to generate greater visibility. The "Collaborations" section of Supply Chain Insights is what enables this, allowing you to review and manage what data you are sharing with and receiving from your Partners.

# Data collaboration
Data collaborations are what enable you to request and share data with one or more Partners.

## How to create a data collaboration
A new data collaboration can be started in two ways. The first is by clicking the "New collaboration button in the top left of the Data collaboration section. The second is by selecting Partners within the All partners tab of the Partners section and then clicking the three dots. After initiating a new data collaboration, a name must be given, Partners must be specified, and some data must be specified before sharing the collaboration. The status of the new data collaboration will stay as "Draft" until the collaboration is shared.

### Partners

You can add or add more Partners depending on if you created the collaboration within the data collaboration section or through the Partners section accordingly. It is possible to add Partners who are part of other collaborations because  Partner can part of multiple collaborations simultaneously. Once added, clicking on a Partner will cause a sidebar to appear where you can write an optional note. Different Partners can receive different notes, all Partners can receive the same note, and not all Partners need to be sent a note. Notes will be seen by the Partner as part of the invitation for the new data collaboration.


### Data requested
The Data requested step presents a list of data entities that can be requested using the toggles provided in the "Request to share?" column. How often you receive updated information for the data entities you are requesting can be seen under the "Requested schedule" column.  Clicking on an item in this column lets you edit how often you get the updated data.

### Data shared
Data shared mirrors Data requested, except it determines what information you will give to your Partners and how often you will update that information.


## How to respond to a data collboration request
Partners may initiate a response to a data collaboration request through the email invitation, notification on their home screen, or the Partners' collaborations tab of the Data collaborations section. Data collaborations which have not been responded to under the collaborations tab will have "Not yet shared" for their entry under the "Data shared" column. 

### Data requested
Partners will be able to see what data entities you requested and choose to comply with those requests or decline them. Declining some data entries does not mean a Partner has declined the data collaboration completely.

### Data shared
Partners can see what information you will be sharing with them.

### Notes and documents
Partners can see what notes and documents you will share with them. They will also be able to respond with their own notes and documents.

### Respond
A partner can click "Share data" or "Decline" in the upper right corner will send a response to your data collaboration request. Regardless of their response, Partners are able to include a comment before being brought back to the Partner's collaborations tab of the Data collaborations section. If the data collaboration was declined, then the collaboration will be removed from the list. If the data collaboration was accepted, then a percentage will appear under the "Data shared" column based on how much data the Partner shared in respect to how much data you requested.

# How to share non-requested data with Partners
If you would like to volunteer information to your Partners, you can update one of the data collaborations under "My org collaborations" and add an additional data entity under "Data shared." 

# How to view data being shared
Data collaborations you create will be listed under "My org collaborations." Each Partner will be able to see your data, and you will be able to see all of your Partners' data. However, your Partners won't be aware of what other companies are involved in the collaboration. This is why they will not be able to see each other's data.

## What you are sharing
For collaborations under "My org collaborations," information on what data you are sharing can be found under the "Data shared" tab.

For collaborations under "Partners' collaborations,", information on what data you are sharing can be found by clicking the percentage under the "Data shared" column. This percentage represents how much of the data your Partner requested is being shared.

## What Partners are sharing
For collaborations under "My org collaborations," you can click on a company under the "Partners" tab once they have accepted their collaboration invitation and their "Data shared" column is updated to a percentage. This percentage represents how much of the data you requested of them is being shared. Clicking on the percentage will show what data entities the Partner is sharing and not sharing.

For collaborations under "Partners' collaborations," you can click on a collaboration and then click the "Data shared" tab.

## Data export and download
Each data entity listed under the "Data requested" tab can be exported.
