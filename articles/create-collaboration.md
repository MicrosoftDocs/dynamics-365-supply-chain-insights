The health of your supply chain is dependent upon your suppliers and customers, making data sharing between you and your partners vital for granting everyone greater visibility into their supply chains. Data collaborations are how Supply Chain Insights makes data sharing a straightforward process, so it can then generate more insights about your supply chain by taking into account your partners' information.


# Prerequisites
Before starting a collaboration, make note of what happens and can happen when you share your data with partners within Supply Chain Insights along with what responsibilities related to this data falls upon you and Microsoft to ensure this meets your companies' expectations. When sharing data with partners, your data may be copied to a different region if you are sharing it with a partner who holds their Supply Chain Insights data in a different location from you. Additionally, partners may view and use your data within Supply Chain Insights and/or use your data outside of Supply Chain Insights by exporting the data you have shared with them. Please refer to [Supply Chain Insight's terms and conditions](https://aka.ms/scitc) to review your and Microsoft's responsibilities concerning data sharing.

Collaborations require connected partners who use Supply Chain Insights and ingested data to share with them.


# Create a data collaboration 
 ## Send a request
 Select the "New collaboration" button in the top left of the "Data collaboration" section of the application to start a new data collaboration. After initiating a new data collaboration, a name must be entered, partners must be chosen, and some data must be specified before sharing the collaboration.

 ## Add partners
You can add one or more partners depending on if you created the collaboration within the data collaboration section or through the partners section accordingly. It is possible to add partners who are in other collaborations because  the same partner can join multiple collaborations simultaneously. Once added, clicking on the chat icon by a partner's name will cause a sidebar to appear where you can write an optional note. Different partners can receive different notes, all partners can receive the same note, and not all partners need to be sent a note. Notes will be seen by the partner as part of the invitation for the new data collaboration.

## Request data from parters
The "Data requested" tab presents a list of data entities that can be requested using the toggles provided in the "Request to share?" column. All, none, or some entities can be requested.

## Share data with partners
The format of the "Data shared" tab mirrors the "Data requested" tab, except it determines what information you will share with your partners instead of what information your partners will share with you.

# Respond to a request
You may respond to a data collaboration request through the email invitation, notification on the home screen, or the "Partners' collaborations" tab of the "Data collaborations" section. Data collaborations which have not been responded to under the "Partners' collaborations" tab will have a 0% visibility score and a "Decline" button in the top right once clicked. Beyond the "Decline" button, clicking on a data collaboration will show more information on what data is being shared.

## View the requested data and share your data
The "Data requested" tab of a partner's collaboration contains a table of what data entities are requested and which ones you are sharing. You don't need to share all the requested entities to accept the collaboration and you can also share non-requested data.

## View the data shared with you
The "Data shared" tab is very similar to the "Data requested" tab, but there is nothing for you to interact with here. This tab only contains information for what data your partner is sharing with you in this collaboration. If this partner is involved in other collaborations with you, then they may already be sharing some of the data listed in this tab.

## View and add notes
The "Notes" tab contains notes sent from your partner and yourself.

## Respond
After reviewing a data collaboration request, select "Share data" or "Decline" in the upper right corner to send a response. If you decide to decline the collaboration, then the collaboration will be removed from the "Partners' collaborations" tab. If the data collaboration was accepted, then a percentage will appear under the "Visibility score" column in the "Partners' collaborations" tab based on how much data you shared in respect to how much data was requested of you.
