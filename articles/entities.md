Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights organizes its data by labeling it in order to analyze it for insights. To do so, Supply Chain Insights has users ingest data by entity. 
Entities are collections of attributes that come together to make a concept. 
Supply Chain Insights contains many entities to represent different parts of a supply chain, and each of these entities have attributes to describe them. 
For example, a vendor is an entity containing attributes related to their name, location, and more.
