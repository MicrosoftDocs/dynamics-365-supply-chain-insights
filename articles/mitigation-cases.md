# Mitigation cases

[!include[banner](includes/banner.md)]

Supply Chain Insights surfaces many risks through many features and mitigation cases enables users to capture the risks they deem most important in order to quickly respond to them. Capturing risks and their associated information in a case then provides the context necessary for creating actionable plans. These plans can be used for the risk in the case that was just created or plans described in old cases can be used as references for approaching new cases with similar issues to the past.

# Open a new case

There are multiple entry points to open a new mitigation case in and outside the **Mitigation cases** section under **Risk management**. Within the **Mitigation cases** section, selecting **New mitigation case** will start the process of creating a new case. Selecting a site on the map and clicking the three dots menu on the top-left of the sidebar will present you with another entry point. The **News** section offers two entry points once you select an article. There is a **Mitigation case** button at the top of the screen and an **Add** button for each impacted partner. Finally, you can create a new mitigation case from the **Connected partners** tab of the **Partners** section. Another **Mitigation case** button at the top of the screen can be found there.

All of these entry points pulls up a sidebar on the righthand side of the screen with questions asking you to describe the risk. Clicking **Save** on the sidebar will create a new case based on the information entered and keep you in the context of wherever the case was created from. More information can be added afterwards by viewing the case details. This can be done by clicking the link provided in the toast notification in the upper-left after creating the case or by going into the Mitigation cases section of the application.

# Find a case

You can either stay where you opened a new case or go view the case details via the toast notification in the top right that will appear once you save the new case. Otherwise, you can go to the **Mitigation cases** section under **Risk management** to access three tables of mitigation cases corresponding to the three tabs on the page: **Active," "Resolved," and "Dismissed."** The **Active** table of cases are for risks that require more work, **Resolved** cases are for risks that have been addressed, and **Dismissed**" cases are for risks that were not addressed but no longer pose a threat.

# Update a case
## Descriptive information
To edit the descriptive information which was inputted when the case was created, open the case and select **Edit case**. The sidebar will appear once more so you can update the necessary descriptive fields.

## Notes
Users can add notes to a case to suggest actions to their peers, share an execution plan, and provide updates on what has been done to address the risk. Documenting the mitigation process here makes the case a much better resources to guide the response for future risks about a similar problem.

## Attach items
### Relevant entities
You can associate certain entities with a mitigation case to provide more information on the impact of the case's risk. Customer and vendors may be associated as partners, production plants and warehouses may be associated as sites, order entities as orders, and items as parts. There are two ways of adding these entities to a page. From the overview page, click on the three dots menu for the information type you'd like to add or go to the corresponding tab to find an **Add X** button in the upper-lefthand corner. This will pull up a sidebar where you can select which records to add to the case.

### Actions
Mitigation actions can be added to a case in a similar way to the relevant entities. While the notes capability is more suited to provide detailed information on was done to resolve the risk, adding actions provides a high-level summary of how the case was solved.
