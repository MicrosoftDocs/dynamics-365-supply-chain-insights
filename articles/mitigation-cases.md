The mitigation cases feature in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights enables users to capture the risks they determine to be the most important so that they can respond quickly. By capturing risks and the associated information in a case, Supply Chain Insights provides the context necessary for users to create actionable plans. Plans established from older cases can be used as a reference when users analyze new cases that have similar issues to the older cases.

## Open a case

1. There are a few ways you can opstart the process of opening e a new case.
- Under **Risk management**, in the **Mitigation cases** section, select **New mitigation case**.  
- Select a site on a map and then select the vertical ellipses menu on the top left of the sidebar.
- In the **News** section, select an article. Select **Mitigation case** at the top of the screen or **Add** for each impacted partner.
- In the **Partners** section, on the **Connected partners** tab, select **Mitigation case**.
1. In the sidebar, enter a description of the risk.
1. Select **Save**. A new case is created. 
1. To add more information later, go to **Mitigation cases** and select the case details.

## Find a case

Under **Risk management**, in the **Mitigation cases** section, there are tabs that display **Active**, **Resolved**, and **Dismissed** cases. 
- **Active** - Cases for risks that require more work.
- **Resolved** - Cases for risks that have been addressed.
- **Dismissed** - Cases for risks that were not addressed but no longer pose a threat.

## Update a case
### Descriptive information
To edit the descriptive information that was entered when the case was created, select the case, and then select **Edit case**. Enter changes in the appropriate fields in the sidebar. 

### Notes
You can add notes to a case to suggest tasks for your peers, share an execution plan, provide updates on what was done to address the risk, and more. Notes make the case more valuable as a reference for future risks concerning a similar problem.

### Attach items
#### Relevant entities
You can associate certain entities with a mitigation case to provide more information on the impact of the risk of the case. For example, customers and vendors can be associated as partners, production plants and warehouses can be associated as sites, order entities as orders, and items as parts. From the **Overview** page, select the vertical ellipses menu next to the information type you'd like to add. A sidebar opens where you can select which records to add to the case.

#### Actions
You can also add mitigation actions to a case from the **Overview** page. While the notes section is usually more helpful when you want to provide detailed information on was done to resolve the risk, adding actions provides a high-level summary of how the case was solved.
