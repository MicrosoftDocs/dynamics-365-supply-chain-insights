# Metadata and Markdown template

[!include[banner](includes/banner.md)]
[!include[banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

What you need to know and need to share with your partners can change over time. To accommodate these changes, you can review, edit, and delete collaborations as needed.


# Review
Data collaborations you create will be listed under "My org collaborations." Select a collaboration to learn more about it or to edit it. Each partner in a collaboration will be able to see your data, and you will be able to see all of your partners' data. However, your partners won't be aware of what other companies are involved in the collaboration and can't see each other's data.

## What you are sharing
For collaborations under "My org collaborations," information on what data you are sharing can be found under the "Data shared" tab. For collaborations under "Partners' collaborations," information on what data you are sharing can be found by clicking the percentage under the "Data shared" column. This percentage represents how much of the data your Partner requested is being shared.

For collaborations under "Partners' collaborations," you can click on a collaboration and then click the "Data requested" tab.


## What partners are sharing
For collaborations under "My org collaborations," you can click on a company under the "Partners" tab once they have accepted their collaboration invitation and their "Data shared" column is updated to a percentage. This percentage represents how much of the data you requested of them is being shared. Clicking on the percentage will show what data entities the Partner is sharing and not sharing.

For collaborations under "Partners' collaborations," you can click on a collaboration and then click the "Data shared" tab.

# Edit
## Your collaborations
Remove or add entities to what you are sharing and requesting to edit collaborations. Select an entity under the "Data requested" or "Data share" tab then choose "Remove" from its contextual menu. Alternatively, select "Request data" from the top bar when no entities or partners are selected. This will let you choose to add or remove entities to be requested. Selecting "Share data" from the top bar instead of "Request data" lets you choose to add or remove entities to what you are sharing.

The "Add partners" button can also be found on the top bar if more partners should be added to the collaboration. If a partner should be removed from the collaboration, select "Remove" from the partner's contextual menu within the "Partners" tab. 

3# Your partners' collaborations
There are only two ways in which you can edit a partner's data collaboration that you are taking part in. Within the "data requested" tab within the data collaboration you wish to edit, are only able to change what data you are sharing. The "Leave collaboration" button on the top bar is also available when no entities are selected.

# Delete 
Data may be deleted when you remove requested entities amongst collaborations within "My org collaborations" or when you delete one of the collaborations you created. Similarly, data may be deleted when you stop sharing entities amongst collaborations within "Partners' collaborations" or when you leave one of these collaborations. It can take up to 48 hours for this change to take effect, but it will not affect any other collaborations where the same entity is being shared from the same company.
