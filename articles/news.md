# Curated news feature

This topic describes the curated news feature included in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights.

Supply Chain Insights is designed to enable users to identify and respond to external risks. One way this is accomplished is by gathering information on world events and presenting you with only the news that is relevant to your company and partner companies. Supply Chain Insights uses your company's and your vendor companies' names provided during initial onboarding to curate the news articles.

## Prerequisites

News articles are sorted based on how relevant the news article is to a company and its supply chain using a trained AI model. Initial news will be populated based on company, vendor and customer names entered during the onboarding process. When additional vendors or customers are imported to Supply Chain Insights or a connection is made with another Supply Chain Insights participant, news will be curated for those companies.  

## Functionality

Supply Chain Insights curates recent relevant news articles using a trained AI model that identifies articles that impact a supply chain. It then presents them as tiles on the **Home** and **News** pages of the application. Selecting **Read article** on a tile will open the news story in a new tab. Selecting **View impacts** will take you to a page specific to that news article where you can view which partners in your supply chain are potentially impacted.
