Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights aims to enable users to identify and respond to risks. Supply Chain Isights gathers information on world events and presents the ones which may impact your supply chain because risks can be caused by rapidly changing external conditions.

# Prerequisites
In order for Supply Chain Insights to determine what information is relevant to your supply chain, vendor, customer, and company profile data must be ingested. This is because company name, site locations, and industry are all used to determine relevancy.

# News
Supply Chain Insights curates recent news articles and presents them as tiles on the home page and in the news section of the application. Clicking "view impacts" on a tile will show what partners may be affected by the world event while "Read article" will open a new tab with the news story.


# Weather
Supply Chain Insights also collects and presents data on weather events. These may come up in news articles, but it also uses other sources for the weather-related information displayed on the supply chain map. Visit [Supply chain map](relative link) to learn how weather information is used there.
