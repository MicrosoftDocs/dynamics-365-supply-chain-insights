Supply Chain Insights aims to enable users to identify and respond to external risks including news and weather events. This is accomplished by gathering information on world events and presenting only the information that is relevant to your company and partner companies. 

# Prerequisites
Supply Chain Insights uses your company's and your vendor companies' names provided during initial onboarding to curate news articles. News articles are sorted based on how relevant the news article is to a company and its supply chain using a pre-trained AI model. Initial news will be populated based on company, vendor and customer names entered during the onboarding process. Additionally when vendors or customers are imported to Supply Chain Insights or a connection is made with another Supply Chain Insights participant, news will be curated for those companies.  

# News
Supply Chain Insights curates recent relevant news articles using a pre-trained AI model to identify articles that impact a supply chain. It then presents them as tiles on the "Home" and "News" sections of the application. Clicking "Read article" on a tile will open the news story in a new tab. Select view impacts to be taken to a page specific to that news article where you can view which partners in your supply chain are potentially impacted.

# Weather
Supply Chain Insights also collects and presents risk data on weather events.  Visit [Supply chain map](/articles/supply-chain-map.md) to learn more about how Supply Chain Insights displays weather risk for your supply chain.
