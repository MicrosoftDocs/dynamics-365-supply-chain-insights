Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights aims to enable users to identify and respond to external risks such as news and weather events. Supply Chain Insights gathers information on world events and presents articles that are relevant to your company or partners.

# Prerequisites
Supply Chain Insights uses your company's and vendor company name provided in the initial onboarding to curate news articls. The relevancy of these articles is determined by these companies' names. When a list of vendors are uploaded to Supply Chain Insights, these companies' names will also be added to the news results. News articles are sorted based on their relevancy to a given company.

In future releases, Supply Chain Insights will utilize site locations and details provided in the basic company profile to enhance the news making it more relevent. Supply Chain Insights will also apply AI models to the news articles assigning a low/medium/high impact score to each article predicting the potential impact of a news event to a supply chain. 

# News
Supply Chain Insights curates recent news articles and presents them as tiles on the home page and in the dedicated news section of the application. Clicking "view impacts" on a tile will show what partners may be affected by the world event while "Read article" will open a new tab with the news story.

In future releases, new surveys and cases will be able to be created based off a news article.

# Weather
Supply Chain Insights also collects and presents data on weather events. These may come up in news articles, but it also uses other sources for the weather-related information displayed on the supply chain map. Visit [Supply chain map](/articles/supply-chain-map.md) to learn how weather information is used there.
