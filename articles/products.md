# Overview
The productions section of Supply Chain Insights contains a catalogue of all the products you sell. Choose a product then select "details" in the top right or select "details" after opening the contextual menu using the three dots. This will present you the page for that product which contains two tabs, one for "details" and another for "bill of materials."  The "bill of materials" tab for a product shows what parts are used in manufacturing the product. Clicking on a part will open a pane containing details. Alternatively, selecting "details" after opening the contextual menu via the three dots will take you to the product page for that part, mirroring the two-tab, "details" and "bill of material" page for the original product that was viewed.
