This topic describes the products page of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights.

Products are often manufactured goods that require materials to be created. The products section of Supply Chain Insights contains a catalogue of all the products you sell and enables you to easily identify what materials are required for each product to highlight the dependencies in your supply chain.

Choose a product then select "Details" in the top right or select "Details" after opening the contextual menu using the vertical ellipsis. This will present you the page for that product which contains two tabs, one for "Details" and another for "Bill of materials."  

The **Bill of materials** tab for a product shows what parts are used in manufacturing the product. Selecting a part opens a pane on the right containing details about the part such as the product name, product ID, and product description. 

Alternatively, selecting "Details" after opening the contextual menu via the vertical ellipsis will take you to the product page for that part, mirroring the two-tab, "Details" and "Bill of material" page for the original product that was viewed.

## Prerequisites

For the "Products" page to function, the entities for products and their corresponding bills of material must be ingested into Supply Chain Insights according to the process outlined in [Ingestion](ingestion.md).
