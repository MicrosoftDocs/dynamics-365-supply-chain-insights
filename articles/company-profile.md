# Company profile

In your company profile in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights, you can add general information and corporate details, financial information, certifications, and corporate social responsibility actions.

## Set up your company profile

You must complete three steps to onboard to Supply Chain Insights.

1. [Import your data](ingest-data.md).
2. Complete your company profile.
3. [Create your supply chain network](partners.md).

You should set up your company profile after you import your supply chain data because Supply Chain Insights will use all this information to gather relevant news articles and recommend partners.

Your company profile initially contains only the name of your company and the profile picture. This data is based on the information in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. To update your company profile, select **Company profile** in the left navigation, and then select **Edit** or **Add** in the upper-right corner of the profile section that you want to update. You can complete each part of the company profile section separately if you don't have all the information available or you want to finish your profile later.

## Set your company profile to public

To make your profile discoverable by other partners, set the **Profile visibility** field on the **Basic information** tab to **Public**. If your profile is public, other partners can discover it on the **Partners \> Find Partners** tab, and they can connect with you to collaborate and derive data insights. All information on the **Basic Information** tab of your company profile is shown to all participants in Supply Chain Insights.

If the **Profile visibility** field is set to **Private**, unconnected partners can't discover your profile and details, and they can't connect with you. However, all information on the **Basic Information** tab of your company profile is still shown to your connected partners.
