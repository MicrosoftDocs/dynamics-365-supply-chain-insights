# Company profile

In your company profile in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights, you can add general information and corporate details, financial information, certifications, and corporate social responsibility actions.

## Complete your company profile
Your company profile initially contains only the name of your company and the profile picture. This data is based on the information in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. To update your company profile, select **Company profile** in the left navigation, and then select **Edit** or **Add** in the upper-right corner of the profile section that you want to update. You can complete each part of the company profile section separately if you don't have all the information available or you want to finish your profile later.

## Public and private company profiles

To make your profile discoverable by other partners users, set the **Profile visibility** field on the **Basic information** tab to **Public**. If your profile is public, other users can discover it on the **Partners \> Find Partners** tab, and they can connect with you to collaborate and derive data insights. If you choose to set this field to public, all information in the **Company details** section of the **Basic Information** tab of your company profile is shown to all participants in Supply Chain Insights.


If the **Profile visibility** field is set to **Private**, unconnected partners can't discover your profile and can't connect via the list of companies on the **Partners  \> Find Partners** tab. The only way other users can initiate a connection with you is if they manually send an connection request to your email. Once you have connected with a partner, the **Company details** section of the **Basic Information** tab of your company profile will be visible to that connected partner.
