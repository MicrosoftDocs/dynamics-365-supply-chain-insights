Supply Chain Insights lets users connect with current and new business partners to make risk identification easier through data sharing. The company profile allows users to make educated connections, allowing you to create a bio and set your visibility for partners and potential partners to learn more about you before connecting.


# Setup
Completing your company profile is the second recommended onboarding step because Supply Chain Insights uses this information to generate insights specific to a user's company. The company profile will only contain the company's name and profile picture based upon your Azure Active Directory tenant initially. Every part of each company profile section can be completed individually in the event that a user does not have all the information on hand. By clicking the "Edit" or "Add" button in the upper right-hand corner of the respective part, you can complete or update their company profile according to the pane that will appear on the right.

# Profile visibility
Under the  "Basic information" tab of the "Company profile" page, you can make your company profile information public or private to others. A private company profile will not be discoverable from the "Find partners" tab of the "Partner management" page, but it will be viewable by any connected Partners. A public company profile will be discoverable from the 'Find partners" tab, and is viewable by any connected  Partners.
