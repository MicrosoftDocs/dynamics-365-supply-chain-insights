# Company profile

In your company profile in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights, you can add general information and corporate details, financial information, certifications, and corporate social responsibility.  

## Set up your company profile

There are three steps you need to complete to onboard to Supply Chain Insights. [Import your data](/articles/ingestion.md), complete your [company profile](/articles/company-profile.md), and [create your supply chain network](/articles/partners.md). Setting up your company profile should come after you import your supply chain data because Supply Chain Insights will use all of this information to gather relevant news articles and recommend partners. 

Initially, your company profile will only contain the company name and profile picture, based on your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. To update your company profile, select **Edit** or **Add** in the upper right corner of the section you want to update. You can complete each part of the company profile section individually if you don't have all the information on hand or want to finish your profile at a later time. 

## Set your company profile to public

To make your profile discoverable to other partners, set **Profile visibility** in the **Basic information** tab to **Public**. If your profile is public, other partners can discover your profile and connect with you to collaborate and derive data insights. Any information on the **Basic Information** tab on your company profile will be displayed for all participants in Supply Chain Insights. 

If **Profile visibility** is set to **Private**, non-connected partners won't discover your profile and details in **Find Partners**, and they can't connect with you. However, your **Basic Information** is still displayed to your connected partners.
