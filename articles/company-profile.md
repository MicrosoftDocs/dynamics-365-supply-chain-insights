Supply Chain Insights lets you connect with your business partners to gain visibility and better risk assessment within your supply chain. Under the company profile, you may add general information and corporate details, financial information, certifications, and corporate social responsibility. Every part of each company profile section can be completed individually in case you do not have all the information on hand. 

# Setup
Completing your company profile is the second recommended onboarding step because Supply Chain Insights uses this information to gather relevant news articles and recommend partners. The company profile will only contain the company's name and profile picture based upon your Azure Active Directory tenant initially. Every part of each company profile section can be completed individually in the event that a user does not have all the information on hand. By clicking the "Edit" or "Add" button in the upper right-hand corner of the respective part, you can complete or update their company profile according to the pane that will appear on the right.

# Profile visibility
You can make your profile visible to other partners by setting the "Profile visibility" in the "Basic information" tab as Public. This will allow partners to discover your profile and connect with you for collaborating and deriving data insights. In that case, any information provided under "Basic information" tab of your profile will be visible to all participant in Supply Chain Insights. 

In case your profile visibility is set to Private, non connected partners will not discover your profile and details in the "Find Partners" and will not be able to connect with you. However, your profile Basic information will still be visible to your connected partners.
